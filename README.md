# Paint

This project was created in Binghamton's Research Immersion program. The goal of this project is to use cv2 and numpy to access the mouseclick and freely manipulate a digital canvas using the tools provided by these two packages.

To run the program, download paint.py and in the commandline enter "python paint.py".
Once run, slide the bars to create whatever color you'd like to use by the colors' RGB value.
The following tools can be used:
Brush: Click b once, then hold left mouseclick and move your cursor around anywhere on the screen.
Line: Click l once, and then hold left mouseclick to begin the line, then drag the cursor in any direction anywhere else and let go of left mouseclick to complete the line. 
Rectangle: Click r once, then hold left mouseclick to begin a corner of the rectangle, then drag the cursor in any direction anywhere else and let go of left mouseclick to complete the opposite corner and the entire rectangle.
Polygon: Click p once, then tap the left mouseclick as many times as desired anywhere on the canvas. Then, to create the polygon, rightclick anywhere inside the points you made.
Fill: Click f once, then left click anywhere in the canvas to fill it with the desired color. 
Quit: Click q
